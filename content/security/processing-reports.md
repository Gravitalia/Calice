# Account suspension and appeal
There are two types of account suspension:

- *Suspension by staff*: following too many reports from our users, a call is made to our support team. If there is indeed a breach of the rules, our support staff may suspend your account, or block your content.

- *Automatic suspension*: following a significant number of reports (over 25% of the number of subscribers, or 100 reports), your account or content is automatically blocked. Support teams are notified to verify the legitimacy of the situation immediately.

# Report taken into account by the team
Each report is dealt with in a different way.

The first reports a user or content receives are simply recorded in a database, which can be checked at any time by the support, no action is taken at this point, unless the support decides to do so. This concerns all content with **less than 15% of reports** in relation to subscribers/likes.

Next comes the alert to support, which may or may not have priority, depending on the number of reports, it must be **more than 15% of reports** in relation to subscribers/likes OR more than 10 reports (e.g. if Gravitalia has 150,000 subscribers, and 23,000 people report it, staff will be alerted) OR if the user has 10 reports (e.g. Hinome has 3 subscribers, but 12 reports, it falls into this category).

And finally, when a user has **more than 25% of reports** in relation to his subscriber base, he is automatically suspended. Naturally, support staff are alerted as soon as possible to verify the veracity of the reports, and to clear up any mistakes.
